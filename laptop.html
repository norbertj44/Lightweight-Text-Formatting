<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop">laptop</a> computer or notebook computer, also known as a laptop or notebook, is a small, portable personal computer (PC). Laptops typically have a clamshell form factor with a flat-panel screen on the inside of the upper lid and an alphanumeric keyboard and pointing device on the inside of the lower lid. Most of the computer&#39;s internal hardware is fitted inside the lower lid enclosure under the keyboard, although many modern laptops have a built-in webcam at the top of the screen, and some even feature a touchscreen display. In most cases, unlike tablet computers which run on mobile operating systems, laptops tend to run on desktop operating systems, which were originally developed for desktop computers.</p>
<p>The word laptop, modeled after the term desktop (as in desktop computer), refers to the fact that the computer can be practically placed on the user&#39;s lap; while the word notebook refers to most laptops sharing a form factor with paper notebooks. As of 2024, in American English, the terms laptop and notebook are used interchangeably; in other dialects of English, one or the other may be preferred. The term notebook originally referred to a type of portable computer that was smaller and lighter than mainstream laptops of the time, but has since come to mean the same thing and no longer refers to any specific size.</p>
<h4 id="-smaller-and-larger-laptops-"><strong>Smaller and larger laptops</strong></h4>
<p>There were in the past a number of marketing categories for smaller and larger laptop computers; these included &quot;notebook&quot; and &quot;subnotebook&quot; models, low-cost &quot;netbooks&quot;, and &quot;ultra-mobile PCs&quot; where the size class overlapped with devices like smartphones and handheld tablets, and &quot;Desktop replacement&quot; laptops for machines notably larger and heavier than typical to operate more powerful processors or graphics hardware.</p>
<h4 id="-2-in-1-pc-"><strong>2-in-1 PC</strong></h4>
<p>The latest trend of technological convergence in the portable computer industry spawned a broad range of devices, which combined features of several previously separate device types. The hybrids, convertibles, and 2-in-1s emerged as crossover devices, which share traits of both tablets and laptops. All such devices have a touchscreen display designed to allow users to work in a tablet mode, using either multi-touch gestures or a stylus/digital pen.</p>
<p>Convertibles are devices with the ability to conceal a hardware keyboard. Keyboards on such devices can be flipped, rotated, or slid behind the back of the chassis, thus transforming from a laptop into a tablet. Hybrids have a keyboard detachment mechanism, and due to this feature, all critical components are situated in the part with the display. 2-in-1s can have a hybrid or a convertible form, often dubbed 2-in-1 detachable and 2-in-1 convertibles respectively, but are distinguished by the ability to run a desktop OS, such as Windows 10. 2-in-1s are often marketed as laptop replacement tablets.</p>
<h4 id="-rugged-laptop-"><strong>Rugged laptop</strong></h4>
<p>A rugged laptop is designed to reliably operate in harsh usage conditions such as strong vibrations, extreme temperatures, and wet or dusty environments. Rugged laptops are bulkier, heavier, and much more expensive than regular laptops, and thus are seldom seen in regular consumer use.</p>
<h4 id="-laptop-hardware-"><strong>Laptop Hardware</strong></h4>
<p>The basic components of laptops function identically to their desktop counterparts. Traditionally they were miniaturized and adapted to mobile use. The design restrictions on power, size, and cooling of laptops limit the maximum performance of laptop parts compared to that of desktop components, although that difference has increasingly narrowed.</p>
<p>In general, laptop components are not intended to be replaceable or upgradable by the end-user, except for components that can be detached; in the past, batteries and optical drives were commonly exchangeable. Some laptops feature socketed processors with sockets such as the Socket G2, but many laptops use processors that are soldered to the motherboard. Many laptops come with RAM and storage that is soldered to the motherboard and cannot be easily replaced. This restriction is one of the major differences between laptops and desktop computers, because the large &quot;tower&quot; cases used in desktop computers are designed so that new motherboards, hard disks, sound cards, RAM, and other components can be added. Memory and storage can often be upgraded with some disassembly, but with the most compact laptops, there may be no upgradeable components at all.  </p>
